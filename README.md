# APA_Thrift_App

## Data_mine_poshmark
This is the code I used to mine price range data for the App. The DF inputs a an excel file with brand lists 
and cleans a little bit. Then it cycles through the types and collect prices a page at a time for each brand.
If possible it collects 8 pages from that brand. Each of the items are checked to see if the brand name is 
contanied in the item. 

## App
After the first draft is complete will include the code here.
